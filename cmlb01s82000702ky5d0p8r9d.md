## Introduction

Modern cloud infrastructure must be designed with **scalability, fault tolerance, and observability** in mind. In this project, I built a highly available setup by deploying multiple virtual servers (Droplets), configuring a Load Balancer to manage incoming traffic, and ensuring monitoring and automated backups were properly enabled.

This blog documents the **end-to-end process** I followed, demonstrating real-world cloud and DevOps best practices using **DigitalOcean**.

---

## Project Objectives

The main goals of this deployment were to:

* Provision **multiple Linux-based Droplets**
    
* Deploy the same application across all servers
    
* Configure a **Load Balancer** to distribute traffic evenly
    
* Enable **monitoring and health checks**
    
* Configure **automatic backups** for data protection and disaster recovery
    
* Test failover and traffic distribution
    

This architecture closely resembles what is used in **production environments** to guarantee uptime and performance.

---

## Architecture Overview

The infrastructure consists of:

* Multiple Ubuntu Droplets running the same application
    
* A DigitalOcean Load Balancer placed in front of the Droplets
    
* Monitoring and alerting enabled at the Droplet level
    
* Automated backups configured for recovery
    

All incoming requests pass through the Load Balancer, which forwards traffic only to healthy Droplets.

## Step 1: Creating Multiple Droplets

The first step was to provision the Droplets that would host the application.

### Process:

1. Logged into the DigitalOcean dashboard
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1770382466980/5da9daa3-2ec5-4fd8-a66b-5340a2ae297a.png align="center")
    
2. Navigated to **Create → Droplets**
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1770382479374/1b0af3c6-1e61-434d-8c7c-8282ba63914f.png align="center")
    
3. Selected **Ubuntu Linux** as the operating system
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1770382632761/4db01756-8d48-471a-921b-9c398b80d795.png align="center")
    
4. Chose an appropriate Droplet size based on expected workload
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1770382798371/5d35f4ba-0bc6-4250-991c-38698a23111d.png align="center")
    
5. Selected a region closest to users to reduce latency
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1770382836472/2696fe91-f632-4c64-a4d2-473d06f74610.png align="center")
    
6. Enabled **SSH key authentication** for secure access
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1770382934517/37664eff-139e-4337-8d7f-7f2719be4c99.png align="center")
    
7. Created **multiple Droplets with identical configurations**
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1770383232844/f14095a9-d19a-41d5-a746-b1c7b7a3d5ee.png align="center")
    

Using identical Droplets ensures consistency and simplifies scaling and maintenance.

---

## Step 2: Accessing and Preparing the Droplets

Once the Droplets were created, I connected to each one using SSH.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1770385019888/7feebb25-1a51-4371-bde8-1f046605ade0.png align="center")

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1770385039120/73e98b76-bbf6-44e4-82cf-1a96ed096921.png align="center")

### Tasks Performed:

* Updated system packages to the latest versions
    
* Installed required dependencies and a web server
    
* Configured firewall rules where necessary
    
* Ensured all Droplets had the same environment setup
    

```plaintext
apt update && apt install -y apache2 && echo "Hello world,Welcome to server 1" > /var/www/html/index.html
```

This step is critical because **load-balanced systems require uniform server behavior**.

---

## Step 3: Deploying the Application Across All Droplets

After preparing the servers, I deployed the same application to each Droplet.

### Key Actions:

* Copied application files to each Droplet
    
* Configured the web server to serve the application
    
* Ensured the application was reachable via each Droplet’s public IP
    
* Verified application responses were consistent across servers
    

At this stage, each Droplet could independently serve user requests.

Step 4: Creating and Configuring the Load Balancer

To manage incoming traffic efficiently, I created a **DigitalOcean Load Balancer**.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1770386104970/a3b9e115-77aa-43fd-9088-52dadd72bc86.png align="center")

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1770386332383/2900e9b9-d6a6-4579-97c6-27a9c335e4cb.png align="center")

### Load Balancer Configuration:

* Selected the same region as the Droplets
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1770386427326/5e1cf43d-40b8-46fe-8b1d-510ace25508a.png align="center")
    
* Attached all application Droplets to the Load Balancer
    
* Configured forwarding rules:
    
    * HTTP (Port 80)
        
    * HTTPS (Port 443, if SSL is enabled)
        
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1770386476154/3898f692-62b1-4df1-877e-6a04b15c1cb3.png align="center")
    
* Enabled health checks to continuously monitor Droplet availability
    

The Load Balancer automatically routes traffic to healthy Droplets and removes unhealthy ones from rotation.

---

## Step 5: Enabling Monitoring and Health Metrics

Monitoring is essential for understanding system performance and detecting problems early.

### Monitoring Features Enabled:

* CPU usage tracking
    
* Memory utilization
    
* Disk and network I/O
    
* Load Balancer health checks
    
* Droplet uptime monitoring
    

These metrics allow proactive troubleshooting and performance optimization.

---

## Step 6: Configuring Automated Backups

To ensure data protection and fast recovery, I enabled **automatic backups** for each Droplet.

### Benefits of Automated Backups:

* Daily snapshots without manual intervention
    
* Ability to restore a Droplet to a previous working state
    
* Protection against accidental deletion, corruption, or system failure
    

This adds an important layer of resilience to the infrastructure.

---

## Step 7: Testing Load Balancing and Failover

To validate the setup, I tested how traffic was distributed and how the system handled failures.

### Testing Steps:

* Accessed the Load Balancer’s IP address or DNS name
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1770387372172/3303f69b-fa44-4221-853f-ddb7f8b4c414.png align="center")
    
* Reloaded the application multiple times
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1770387455935/e7c52a3c-a141-4664-9cb4-0271f440766b.png align="center")
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1770387469110/ba3a8ed7-ac36-4b0b-a78a-f78e66bb68b6.png align="center")
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1770387490284/8bafa0d1-70c7-44e5-b4b5-486fd6e86fde.png align="center")
    
* Confirmed traffic was served by different Droplets
    
* Stopped one Droplet to simulate failure
    
* Observed the Load Balancer automatically rerouting traffic
    

The application remained available even when a Droplet went offline.

## Key Outcomes and Benefits

This deployment achieved:

* **High Availability** – No single point of failure
    
* **Scalability** – Easy addition or removal of Droplets
    
* **Reliability** – Health checks and failover handling
    
* **Observability** – Real-time monitoring and metrics
    
* **Data Safety** – Automated backups and recovery options

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to build a **scalable, fault-tolerant cloud infrastructure** using DigitalOcean. By combining multiple Droplets, a Load Balancer, monitoring, and automated backups, I implemented an architecture that aligns with real-world DevOps and cloud engineering standards.

This setup is suitable for production workloads and serves as a strong addition to my **cloud and DevOps portfolio**.
