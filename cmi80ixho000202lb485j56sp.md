## **Introduction**

As part of my **Altschool Africa one-year Diploma in Cloud Engineering Program**, I recently completed a second-semester practical assignment focused on strengthening my foundational skills in **Cloud Computing**, **Linux system administration**, and **command-line tools**.  
This assignment was not just theoretical — it required hands-on exploration, testing real commands, managing users, working with permissions, and applying core concepts that every cloud and DevOps engineer must master.

This blog is a **comprehensive, upgraded version** of that assignment. I expanded the original scope by diving deeper into the Linux environment, documenting **15 essential and lesser-known commands**, and breaking everything down into clear, structured sections for easier understanding.  
Whether you're a beginner in cloud engineering or someone looking to sharpen your Linux skills, this write-up provides a practical and beginner-friendly walkthrough of the key concepts I studied.

# **1\. My Understanding of the Cloud**

Cloud Computing refers to a globally distributed network of remote servers and data centers that deliver computing services over the internet. These include:

* Servers
    
* Storage
    
* Databases
    
* Networking
    
* Security
    
* Virtual machines
    
* Software platforms
    

Instead of owning physical infrastructure, cloud users rent resources on demand, enabling **scalability**, **cost efficiency**, **reliability**, and **global accessibility**.

# **2\. My Understanding of Linux as an Operating System**

Linux is a free and open-source operating system created by **Linus Torvalds in 1991**. It manages hardware resources (memory, CPU, storage, networking) and provides a platform where applications run.  
Linux is particularly popular among engineers because of its:

* Security
    
* Flexibility
    
* Lightweight architecture
    
* Open-source community support
    
* Strong presence in cloud, DevOps, and server environments

# **3\. Fifteen Linux Terminal Commands I Researched and Practiced**

As part of the assignment, I initially explored 5 uncommon Linux commands — but I have now added 10 more to make a total of **15 powerful commands** useful for any beginner cloud or DevOps engineer.

You’ll also find an image beneath each command that displays the output you should expect to see when you run it.
